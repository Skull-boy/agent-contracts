## [1.1.3] — 2026-09-05

### Added
- **Gateway Enforcement Layer (`BaseGateway`, `GitHubGateway`, `QdrantGateway`)**:
  - Single enforcement boundary for external API operations and credential management.
  - Per-instance `@enforcer.gate` wrapping with default-deny semantics.
  - Optional dependency handling for `PyGithub` and `qdrant-client` to keep core package dependency-light.
- **Gateway Exception Wrapping**:
  - Introduced `GatewayError` to encapsulate third-party API client exceptions.
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for gateway linting (`.github/workflows/lint-gateway.yml`).

### Changed
- `ContractEnforcer.gate()` now supports `"read"` as an action type alias for permission gating.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-08-30

### Changed
- Version bump with packaging corrections
- pip install scyvera resolves to this release as latest stable
- T8 warning now correctly emitted via logging module 
  (scyvera.enforcer logger) instead of warnings.warn
- T7 wildcard rejection enforced at JSON schema level in addition 
  to Python load-time check — validate_contract() now catches 
  wildcards independently of ContractEnforcer

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added — Runtime Enforcer (Step 3)
- `ContractEnforcer` class: load, freeze, gate, audit, integrity verification
- `ContractEnforcer.gate(action_name, action_type)` decorator — default-deny enforcement of declared side_effects and permissions
- `ContractEnforcer.verify_integrity()` — SHA-256 check detects contract file replacement after load (T5)
- `ContractEnforcer.get_audit_log()` — returns deep-copy frozen AuditEntry list (T9)
- `ContractVersionError` — raised on schema version mismatch (T10)
- `ContractTamperError` — raised on frozen object mutation or disk file replacement (T5, T9)
- `ApprovalPendingError` — raised when action hits an approval_point; approval channel routing is caller's responsibility (stub, documented)
- `assert_gated(fn)` utility for integration test suites (T4)
- T7: wildcard permissions rejected at schema level AND Python load time
- T8: irreversible side effect + empty approval_points emits logging.WARNING via scyvera.enforcer logger
- 59-test suite covering all threat models T1–T10

### Stable Public API (semver-protected from v1.0.0)
- ContractEnforcer.load / gate / get_audit_log / verify_integrity / assert_gated
- ContractViolationError, ContractTamperError, ApprovalPendingError, ContractVersionError, AuditEntry

### What scyvera does NOT guarantee (documented in README)
- Cannot prevent gate bypass if integrator calls ungated function directly (T4 — known limitation)
- Cannot verify that gated function's internal behavior matches its declared permission string (T6 — known limitation)
- Integrity check protects AFTER load only, not before (T5)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added — Contract v1.1 Spec + lifecycle field (Step 2)
- `lifecycle` field added to contract spec (optional, backward compatible)
- v1.1 JSON schema at schemas/v1.1/contract.schema.json
- Default applied by loader when lifecycle absent: {mode: request-response, initiation: human-only, resumability: stateless}
- loader emits logging.WARNING when defaults are applied
- `irreversible` boolean field on side_effects entries
- RFC 0002 (lifecycle field) added to rfcs/
- Three worked examples in spec: request-response, scheduled, persistent
- T1/T2/T3 threat mitigations documented

### Migration
- All v1 contracts (no lifecycle field) remain valid
- No breaking changes to validate_contract() or CLI

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-30

### Fixed — Repository Cleanup (Step 1)
- Canonical filename is now contract.yaml everywhere; contract.yml references removed
- Loader raises actionable error on contract.yml: "Found contract.yml — rename to contract.yaml"
- Backslash folder issue resolved (if it existed)

### Migration
- Rename any contract.yml files to contract.yaml
